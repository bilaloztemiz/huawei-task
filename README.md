# huawei-task

I used vagrant because all steps had to be IAC. 
Servers can be up by entering the folders and typing "vagrant up"

Places where projects were taken:
https://github.com/techiescamp/vagrant-kubeadm-kubernetes
https://github.com/edinc/vagrant-jenkins

There is no step 4 because the time problem.
